        <h2>A Grammaticalization of Facial Expressions of Emotion</h2>

        <p>If you’re ever in disagreement with someone (anyone!), 
            we have the perfect advice for you – action units 4, 14, 17, and 24. 
            These are the codes from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for discrete 
            facial movements that, in this case, give a universal expression of: “no” – otherwise
            known as “the not-face”. Researchers tested people from multiple cultures and
            countries (and signers of American Sign Language), finding that all we are all
            in agreement about how to disagree.</p>

        <p>We might pay attention to what matters, but what we pay attention 
            to will also matter more – that is the finding from Viola Störmer and George Alvarez’s 
            work into attention and attractiveness. They show how even complex, high-order perceptual
             properties – in this case attractiveness – can be shaped by attention. Ultimately, 
             a gaze-contingency task with eye tracking was performed, demonstrating that facial attractiveness 
             is judged to be stronger for faces that were attended to. So the next time you see someone you like –
              make sure to catch their eye.</p>
